# Lab | Tableau+SQL

## Introduction

In this lab, we will practice creating a connection between Tableau and MySQL. Please note, we will use the publusher database/schema, introduced in an earlier lesson, if you do not have this database you can find the .sql script to load it here:

## Getting Started

To complete this lab, follow each of the steps below:

1. Choose 1 of the following ways to connect to your dataset:
 - Connect to your mySQL server, create a dataset from the tables using relationships
 - Connect to your mySQL server, create a dataset from the tables using joins
 - Connect to your mySQL server, create a custom sql query that joins the tables together
 - In mySQL run a query that connects the tables together and export the results to a CSV, use this CSV for import

2. Create calculated fields for: advance amount, sales amount, total amount - releating to the amounts gained by each author. 
3. Create a visualisation showing off the the total amounts gained by each author, sorted in descending order - does this match up with your ealier work in SQL?
4. Create 2 (or more) views/visualisations using this dataset, you decide what and how to show. 
5. Create the dashboard that consists of these visualizations



## Deliverables
1. SQL script (if used)
2. Tableau worksheet
3. Link to the published dashboard

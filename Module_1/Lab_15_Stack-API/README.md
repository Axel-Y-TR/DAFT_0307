# Lab | StackAPI
Let's check if you can handle working with an API. 

Use [StackAPI](https://stackapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python wrapper for the Stack Exchange API, and answer the following questions:

* Question 1: Find the questions and answers of last month.
* Question 2: Find the most voted question today with at least a score of 5 and tagged with 'python'.
  * Not familiar with Epoch/Unix Timestamps?
    * Check out: https://www.epochconverter.com/
    * You can use the tool on the site to manually get the time - or go full hacker, scroll down and check the python code on how it can be converted and create your own function!
  * No results? Check for this week instead.
* Question 3: Find the answers with id 6784 and 6474.


## Deliverables
